This repository demonstrates a potential pitfall when using the `continue` statement in Java loops. The `BuggyContinue.java` file contains code that exhibits unexpected behavior due to the placement of the `continue` statement.  The `FixedContinue.java` file provides a corrected version illustrating best practices.  Understanding the precise effect of `continue` on loop iteration is crucial for writing robust and predictable Java code. The issue lies in how the `continue` statement affects subsequent code execution within the loop body.
